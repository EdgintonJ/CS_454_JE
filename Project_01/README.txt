Project 01

The following is the files with the runnning code:
	Problem1.py

The following is the software needed/used:
	PyCharm 
	Python v 3.8

When running the program:
	
	When the program is started a prompt will apear. The prompt will ask for an input: Problem_1 (1), Problem_2 (2), or Quit (3).
	If 1 is chosen, they will be asked for a string length and after the input is proccessed, the program will
	output all possible strings of that length. If 2 is chosen, the user will be asked for the base number and then will
	be prompted for the language. After both inputs are proccessed, the smallest multiple will be printed if it is found.
	

Notes:

	I took inspiration for making a DFA into a class from a "stack_overflow.com" page, but I can't find the page and 
	I didn't save the address. I think it could've been done without making it into a class, but I was too far in when 
	could see that.

	Some of the naming conventions may be different than what was required.

	The python file is called Problem1.py because I was originally going to do 2 seperate .py files; but after
	it was decided that it had to be in 1 file, I didn't want to change the name and possibly mess up PyCharm.
